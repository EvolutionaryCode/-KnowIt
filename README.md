#KnowIt

KnowIt is a platform that enables teachers to survay their students understanding in a fun/interactive way. KnowIt works for the users, instead of the users having to learn how to work KnowIt. The core of KnowIt is coded on NodeJS and VueJS, NodeJS provides the backend while vue allows us to further the users experince while using KnowIt. Automatically, you have the option to either join by either scanning in a QR Code, Searching By Teacher or enter in a six digit unique code. KnowIt highly reccomends for you're students to create accounts, we offer Google Sign-in as-well just to make sure we form to you're needs. Automatically, you pick either if you are a Student or Teacher. After you create you're account; using a compenent in VueJS known as Vue-tour, we will guide you through the aspects of the app that you're job (Student or Teacher) needs to fullfil.

Teachers-
Teachers are guided through creating new lists, adding students, creating classes, manigning classes creating assignments and more.

Students- 
By a student being logged in, we can allow the student to compete on leaderboards. Students, will also get a weekly email or after they have sent in/complete a task. In the future, we plan on adding a mobile app that would allow us to send push notifications to the students phone for reminders, and an unique attempt at momorizing content. 

Creating Assignments & Tasks- 
In-order to use KnowIt's understanding capabilities, we have Lists & Tasks that allow you to add Vocabulary, Multiple Choice Questions, Typing Speed Tests, Timed Questions and Short Response.

Security Within #KnowIt-
KnowIt is the only quiz/assignement platform that has been built up with security in mind. KnowIt, will offer a feature for you to request your data, or delete all of you're data. Not getting into specifics but, we do have monitors setup to filter out bots and outright make it near impossible for an-answer bot to be made. We have systems in-place so if a new Device or location is detected and you have extra security enabled you will need to get the six digit code either via Text or Email.

For The IT Departments- 
KnowIt is built on the k8 framework, this allows us/you to quickly test and deploy accross a number of servers. K8 allows us to provide updates and makes managing the reources within the Product pie. 

This project is Open Source, meaning it is allowed to be used/taken as-long as credit is given.
